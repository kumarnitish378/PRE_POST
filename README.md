## Steps should be taken to define P Wave morphology 
1. General contour
2. P Wave Duration
3. positive and negetive Amplitude
4. Axis in the frontal and transverse planes.

## General Contour
* It generally Smooth and entirely positive or negetive or monophesic. except V1 and V2

## P wave Duration
* Normally < 0.12 second
* It's indicate the relative time of activation in the right and left atria.

## Positive and Negetive Amplitudes
* Normally no more than 0.2 mv in frontal plane leads.
* normally no more than 0.1 mv in transverse plane leads.

## Axis in the frontal and transvers planes.
* P Wave Normally appers entirely upright and left ward and inferiorly oriented leads such as I, II, aVF and V4 To V6.

* P wave axis are between 0 and +75 degree.

## There are basically Four type of P wave observed 
1. Normal
2. RAE (Right Atrial Enlargments)
3. LAE (Left Atrial Enlargnments)
4. RAE + LAE (Both Enlargments)
